# README
Here lie my solutions to problems from [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)!

## About
Advent of Code is my favorite place for programming puzzles, and it brings me a great deal of fun every december. I'll have to hunt down my code for previous years, which issomewhere on a old machine of mine. 

## Notes
Days are split into their first and second stars. Some days have extra files associated with them, and I forget of these has my final solution :P

There are some random files and test files for some reason.
